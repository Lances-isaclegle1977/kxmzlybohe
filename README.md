Just stepped out and damn, my head’s still spinning like a washing machine trying to swallow a bowling ball. A Working Man—wow. I’m sitting here on this cold, metal bench outside the theater, my popcorn-ridden lap trying to make sense of it. Remember how you’ve been bugging me to download the movie? Yeah, well, watch the movie first, it's like... unexpected, like finding a seagull in your tackle box. And the noise of people shuffling out, sounds like the ocean if the waves complained about sore backs.

The main dude—John? Gosh, or was it Jim? Anyway, he’s trudging around with this sad, worn-out face the whole time, like a fish standing still, waiting for fate or, I dunno, a net to snatch him up. That scene with the busted radio... 

> freakin’ hilarious but also made me think of that old transistor in my shed. And the boss, all big and shouty, like this giant squid of a man, tentacles of expectation everywhere. One minute, steel clanging, next minute, everything’s quiet like the sea in a storm’s eye. Random? Yeah, completely, but dude, it works, it works like... like trying to fry an egg with a candle. 

The seats were sticky, ugh, and my back—feels like it went ten rounds with a brick wall. But the colors! Blue and gray and green, like some seagull’s vision. Still, couldn’t decide if it was gloomy or... just raw? Raw like the taste of salt air on a winter morning. Random scenes keep popping in, like they're weaving in and out of a net. Wait, what was with that scene where he yells at a photocopier? Unhinged, but kinda real, too; felt that frustration right down in my gut.

Why did that one character look like a lobster in a sundress? Was it the lighting or just me being sleepy? Makes me think I need new glasses or more sleep—or both. Can't stop thinking that this movie is like listening to a whale sing but backwards and underwater. And the ending, oh boy, a hazy fog of emotions, like a dawn fishing trip with no fish. 

Was it cohesion or chaos? Maybe both. Download the movie and tell me what you think, just beware of getting lost in it like a fisherman with a holey boat. My fingers are cold from typing, this bench is like Antarctica, and my thoughts are seagulls already forgetting their flight path.

Oh, here's a random bit that just fell out from my notes, not even sure from where:

```python
def fish_dance():
    while True:
        if boat:
            net_cast()
```
